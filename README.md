## Features

- **High-Performance Control:** Real-time PID control loop running on a dedicated core for maximum stability and responsiveness.
- **Dual-Core Architecture:** Leverages the ESP32-S3's dual cores, dedicating one to the control loop and the other to the user interface, ensuring no-compromise performance.
- **Intuitive UI:** On-the-fly adjustments and monitoring via a 128x64 SSD1306 OLED display and a six-button capacitive touch interface.
- **Switchable Tuning Profiles:** Two distinct and saveable presets (A and B) allow for quick changes between different boost levels or tuning strategies (e.g., "street" and "race").
- **In-Depth On-Device Tuning:** A comprehensive menu system allows for live tuning of all critical parameters without needing to re-flash the firmware:
    - PID gains (Kp, Ki, Kd)
    - MAP sensor calibration
    - Solenoid frequency
    - Target boost and pressure limits
    - Signal filtering and timing
- **Performance Analytics:** Innovative "Spool Score" and "Torque Score" metrics provide quantitative feedback on your engine's boost response, allowing for data-driven tuning.
    - **Spool Score:** This metric measures the instantaneous rate of change (peak-derivative) of the boost pressure rise. A higher spool score indicates a faster and more aggressive boost build-up, reflecting efficient turbocharger response.
    - **Torque Score:** This score is derived from the integral of boost pressure over time. It factors in how early boost is achieved and how well it's maintained until a gear shift. Crucially, the torque score penalizes overboosting by subtracting any integral value accumulated above the target boost pressure. This ensures that configurations which avoid undesirable overboost conditions receive a higher, more favorable torque score for accurate comparison and optimal tuning.
- **Persistent Memory:** All settings and tuning profiles are automatically saved to the ESP32's internal EEPROM, ensuring they are retained across power cycles.
- **Hardware-Level Safety:** Includes functionality for factory reset via a touch-hold on boot.

### Tune Scoring (TS) Menu

The Tune Scoring menu provides insights into your boost control performance.

*   **Score Reset Behavior:** If any configuration settings are changed for the active profile (Preset A or B), the Spool Score and Torque Score for that profile will be automatically reset. This ensures that the scores accurately reflect the performance of the *new* settings, requiring re-testing to generate fresh scores.
*   **Saving Scores:** To save the current profile's configuration along with its associated Spool Score and Torque Score values, navigate to the TS menu and press the corresponding `SaveA` or `SaveB` buttons. This allows you to store and compare the performance of different tuning strategies.

## Configuration Menus

The ESP32 Boost Controller features a comprehensive menu system accessible directly on the device via the OLED display and capacitive touch inputs. This section details each configuration parameter, its function, and the context provided by its associated info text.

### PID Tuning Menu

This menu allows for fine-tuning of the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control loop, which is responsible for maintaining target boost pressure.

*   **Kp (P-Gain)**
    *   **Description:** The main driving force of the PID controller. It determines the strength of the immediate response to a boost error.
*   **Ki (I-Gain)**
    *   **Description:** Addresses steady-state errors by accumulating error over time. It helps to eliminate boost droop and ensure the target boost is held consistently.
*   **Kd (D-Gain)**
    *   **Description:** Reacts to the rate of change of the boost error, helping to dampen oscillations and prevent overshoot.
*   **Max I term (Max Integral)**
    *   **Description:** Sets a limit on the accumulated integral error. This prevents "integral 'windup,'" a condition where a large integral value can cause significant overshoot after a disturbance.
*   **Trig. Thres. (PID Trigger)**
    *   **Unit:** kPa
    *   **Description:** Defines how close the current boost pressure needs to be to the target pressure before the PID control loop fully activates. This prevents the PID from reacting to minor fluctuations far from the target.
*   **Press. Limiter (Pressure Limiter)**
    *   **Unit:** kPa
    *   **Description:** A safety feature that forces the wastegate open if the boost pressure exceeds the target pressure by this specified value. This prevents overboost conditions that could damage the engine.
*   **Solenoid Freq. (Solenoid Frequency)**
    *   **Unit:** Hz
    *   **Description:** Sets the operating frequency for the boost control solenoid. This value should be matched to the specifications of your particular solenoid for optimal performance.
    
### MAP Sensor Menu

This menu is used for calibrating the Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor to ensure accurate boost readings.

*   **Pressure Offset**
    *   **Unit:** kPa
    *   **Description:** Allows for a manual correction to the MAP sensor reading to match a known, accurate external gauge.
*   **Min kPa**
    *   **Unit:** kPa
    *   **Description:** The minimum pressure (in kPa) that your MAP sensor is designed to read. This value, along with Max kPa, Min Volts, and Max Volts, must accurately reflect your sensor's datasheet.
*   **Max kPa**
    *   **Unit:** kPa
    *   **Description:** The maximum pressure (in kPa) that your MAP sensor is designed to read.
*   **V Offset (Voltage Offset)**
    *   **Unit:** V
    *   **Description:** The voltage scaling offset from the MAP sensor data sheet(if applicable). If there is no specified voltage offset, leave this value at 0.
*   **Min Volts**
    *   **Unit:** V
    *   **Description:** The minimum voltage output by your MAP sensor at its lowest pressure reading.
*   **Max Volts**
    *   **Unit:** V
    *   **Description:** The maximum voltage output by your MAP sensor at its highest pressure reading.

### Filtering & Misc. Menu

This menu contains parameters related to signal filtering, timing, and general system behavior.

*   **Slow EMA-A (Slow Exponential Moving Average Alpha)**
    *   **Description:** Controls the smoothing applied to boost pressure readings for stable conditions. A lower value results in heavier smoothing, making the readings more stable but less responsive to rapid changes.
    
*   **Fast EMA-A (Fast Exponential Moving Average Alpha)**
    *   **Description:** Controls the smoothing applied during rapid boost changes. A higher value results in less smoothing, making the readings more responsive but potentially more susceptible to noise.
    
*   **P-Rate Thres. (Pressure Rate Threshold)**
    *   **Unit:** kPa
    *   **Description:** The change in pressure (in kPa) required to switch from using the slow EMA filter to the fast EMA filter. This allows for stable readings during steady boost and responsive readings during spool-up.
    
*   **Rate period (Rate Period)**
    *   **Unit:** ms
    *   **Description:** The time window (in milliseconds) over which the pressure rate of change is calculated. This influences how quickly the system detects rapid boost changes.
    
*   **Oversampling**
    *   **Description:** The number of Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) reads averaged together to produce a single pressure measurement. Higher oversampling reduces noise but consumes more CPU time.
    
*   **Save/Reset Delay**
    *   **Unit:** ms
    *   **Description:** The duration (in milliseconds) that the SAVE or RESET button must be held down to activate its function. This prevents accidental activation.
    
*   **Edit/CFG Delay**
    *   **Unit:** ms
    *   **Description:** The duration (in milliseconds) that the EDIT or CFG button must be held down to enter its respective menu.
    
*   **Sleep Delay**
    *   **Unit:** s
    *   **Description:** The amount of idle time (in seconds) at atmospheric pressure before the display and solenoid turn off to conserve power.
    
*   **TS Rate (Torque Score Rate)**
    *   **Unit:** ms
    *   **Description:** The sample rate (in milliseconds) at which data is collected for the Torque Score calculation. A lower value provides more granular data but increases processing load.
